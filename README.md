# BookLiberator

BookLiberator is [free, open source](LICENSE) software that uses
smartphone cameras to liberate text from treeware.  BookLiberator
photographs text on paper and produces a complete digital copy of the
text *as text* (i.e., searchable, editable, able to be displayed in
various typefaces and sizes, etc) alongside the page images.  In
typical usage, no Internet connection is required for the operation of
the BookLiberator software itself; where and how the digital
information is stored or transmitted is up to the user, of course.

BookLiberator is a collaborative project with development led by [Bad
Idea Factory](https://biffud.com/).  We welcome participation from
anyone.  Please see our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information.

As of this writing in February 2020, the project is still at in the
design stage.  If you're looking for working code, try checking back
in a few months.

BookLiberator is a project of [QuestionCopyright.org](https://QuestionCopyright.org/):
